Current systems often lack real-time data and citizen engagement, hindering effective crisis resolution. 

Objective: This work introduces “AquaMap”, a mobile application that aims to revolutionize disaster and crisis management by empowering citizens to contribute ground-level insights on water-related issues through social media images.
